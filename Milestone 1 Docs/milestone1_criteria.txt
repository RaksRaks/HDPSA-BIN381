Project Milestone 1
Introduction
This project will investigate various health and demographic datasets to identify meaningful patterns
and trends. The details of the project requirements are described in the Project Outline document.
The project outline underscores the use of CRISP-DM as a structured approach to guide you through
the data science project, emphasizing its importance in the context of real-world data analysis and
modelling.

Outline
The project is divided into six (6) milestones, where at each stage some deliverables are to be
produced in terms of a series of reports that describe the project plan, and the work carried out during
the iterative process of data preparation, modelling, evaluation and eventual deployment.
While CRISP-DM breaks down a data mining project life cycle into six phases with each phase
consisting of many secondary tasks, the focus of this milestone is on the first two phases. These phases
help organisations understand the objectives of the project from a business perspective and identify,
collect, and analyse the data sets that can help accomplish the project goals. You may need to gather
more information on related projects and scenarios to establish a strong business case for the project.

Understand the Business
Thoroughly understand, from a business (government or non-profit organisations) perspective, what
the project really wants to accomplish. Uncover important factors, that can influence the outcome of
the project, record the information that is known about the business situation during this phase of the
project.

Understand the Data
Start off with the initial data collection and proceed with activities that enable you to become familiar
with the data, identifying data quality problems, discovering first insights into the data, and/or detect
interesting subsets to form hypotheses regarding hidden information.

Tasks
The entire project consists of the following steps which are then broken into milestones that should
be submitted on given due dates.
1. Business Understanding:
• Clearly define the business problem and objectives.
• Identify stakeholders and their requirements.
• Determine the success criteria for the recommendation system.
• Recognize the importance of CRISP-DM as the methodology to guide the project.
2. Data Understanding:
• Explore the provided datasets, including variables like mortality rates, distance to health
facilities, facility types, immunisation rates, water sources, literacy, vaccination rates, etc.
